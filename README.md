# 128bitPercision
This project implements a "128-bit data type" with all its basic mathematical operations

**Details**

* The main goal of this project is to design and implement the multiplication and addition functions between two double precision operands. The return values from your functions are 128-bit floating point data type without any overflow occuring.


* ldfp.c has the implementation of all the functions needed for extraction and manipulation
